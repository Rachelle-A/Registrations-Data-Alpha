MHCLG - Registrations Data Housing Alpha

**The situation:** housing services needs to get properties back into circulation quickly once a tenant dies so that other households on the social housing waiting list can move in. This involves an official process to confirm the death with the deceased tenant’s next of kin (‘NOK’). This is usually a straightforward process that takes c. 2 days.

**The problem:** in roughly 10% of cases housing officers cannot identify the NOK through their usual networks (e.g. families, neighbours, Tell Us Once, other services). This can make the process to close the tenancy difficult and time-consuming (c. 11+ days).

**Partners:** Redditch and Bromsgrove District Council, Worcestershire County Council, East Suffolk District Council, Suffolk County Council, Suffolk Office of Data Analytics, Hackney Council, Worcestershire and Suffolk Registrations services, and Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

**What we found:** registration services have an in-built report on their online information management system (RON) with information about all recent registered deaths in the area. This includes the name and home address of the person that informed the registration service of the death, which is usually the NOK.

**Potential benefits:** if registration services start sending this report directly to housing services it could both greatly reduce the number of difficult investigations that housing officers have to do, and the time they take. This has knock on social and financial benefits, as other households can move into vacant properties much quicker.

**Limitations:** while having the name and address of the NOK in every case that a tenant passes away is helpful, housing officers said that their telephone number would reduce the time spent difficult cases even more. This is not currently captured in registrations data.

**Minimum viable product (MVP):** we recommend that the MVP that would address this issue is a modification of the current in-built RON report, in an excel format, which includes the informant telephone number and strips out a number of unnecessary fields.
